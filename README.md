The Weather App is a simple and interactive web-based application that allows users to search and view weather information for a given location. The app provides essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, as well as an icon representing the current weather condition.

## Features

- **Search Location**: Users can input a location to fetch weather data for that location.
- **Weather Display**: Displays current temperature, weather description, and weather-related icons.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the entered location is not found.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
